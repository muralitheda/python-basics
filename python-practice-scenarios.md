# Python Programming


# 🎯 Variables:

## 1. Create 2 variables with x as 100 & y as 10 respectively and find the Multiplication and Division of both and store in some val as z and z1**

```python
x = 100
y = 10

z = x * y
z1 = x / y

print("type(z)=", type(z))
print("z=", z)

print("type(z1)=", type(z1))
print("z1=", z1)
```

### **✅ Output**

```
type(z)= <class 'int'>
z= 1000

type(z1)= <class 'float'>
z1= 10.0
```
