# Python Programming

## 🎯 Variables

1. Create two variables `x = 100` and `y = 10`, find their multiplication and division, and store the results in variables `z` and `z1`.
2. Create a variable `a = 2000`, divide `a` by `y` (from step 1), and reassign `a` with the divided result.
3. Prove Python is dynamically typed by creating `x: int = 100`, then assigning `y = str(x)` and printing the types of `x` and `y`.
4. Demonstrate Python’s dynamic inference feature with an example showing automatic datatype detection.
5. Prove Python is a strongly typed language using incompatible type operations.
6. Create variables `a, b, c, d` assigned with values `10, 20, 30, 40` respectively.
7. Prove that Python variable names are case-sensitive.
8. Demonstrate that variable names cannot start with numbers or contain special characters (except `_`).
9. Show examples of using single, double, and triple quotes in Python.
10. Demonstrate examples using arithmetic, assignment, comparison, relational, and logical operators.

## 🎯 Conditional Structures

11. Write a program to find the greatest of three numbers.
12. Write a single program to check if a number is even or negative and print the result as:

* “Even but not negative”
* “Not even but negative”
* “Neither even nor negative”

13. Write a nested `if-else` structure to print course fees:

* Big Data → 25000
* Spark → 15000
* Data Science →

  * Machine Learning → 25000
  * Deep Learning → 45000
  * Both → 50000

14. Check whether a given string is a palindrome using a reverse function.
15. Check whether `x = 100` is an integer or a string using functions like `isinstance()` or `type()`.

## 🎯 Control Statements

16. Using a `for` loop, print even and odd numbers in the range `[5–20]`.
17. Write a `while` loop to print multiples of 3 up to 21 and store the results in a list.
18. Write a loop to calculate the cube of 4 using repeated multiplication (4 * 4 * 4 = 64).
19. Given `sal_lst = [10000,20000,30000,10000,15000]`, add a bonus of 1000 to each salary, store it in `sal_bonus_lst`, and create another list for salaries above 11000.
20. Write a `do-while` equivalent loop to print “Inceptez Technologies” `n` times, ensuring it prints at least once.
21. Given `lst1 = [[10,20],[30,40,50],[60,70,80]]`, calculate the total sum, minimum, and maximum values using nested loops.
22. Create a looping construct to print the multiplication table for 3 up to 10.

## 🎯 Collections: List, Dictionary, Tuple, and Set

23. Create a list of numbers from 2 to 11. Demonstrate mutability by updating the 3rd element and resizability by inserting 100 at the 5th position.
24. Create a tuple `("Inceptez", "Technologies", "Pvt", "Ltd")`, prove immutability and non-resizability, and access the 2nd and 4th elements to form another tuple.
25. Convert `[("Inceptez","Technologies"),("Apple","Incorporation")]` into `[{"Inceptez":"Technologies"},{"Apple":"Incorporation"}]`, and demonstrate the difference between `dict[key]` and `dict.get(key)`.
26. Create a list of tuples with duplicates and remove the duplicates.
27. Append a new tuple `("Intel", "Corp")` to the de-duplicated list.
28. Convert `lst_dict = [{"Inceptez":"Technologies"},{"Apple":"Incorporation"}]` to `["Inceptez","Apple"]` using keys and list functions.
29. Given `lst = [10,20,40,30,20]`, perform:

    * Retrieve first and last values
    * Sort ascending & descending
    * Print min, max, and sum
    * Remove 30 and 20
30. Perform the same operations from step 29 on a tuple `(10,20,40,30,20)`.
31. Convert the string `"Inceptez Technologies Pvt Ltd"` to a list `['Inceptez', 'Technologies', 'Pvt', 'Ltd']`.
32. Given

    ```python
    emplstlst = [["1", ("Arun","Kumar"), "10000"], ["2", ("Bala","Mohan"), "12000"]]
    ```

    Perform:
    a. Convert the first sublist to a tuple.
    b. Reverse the first and last name of the second element.
    c. Convert the entire list into tuples of tuples.
    d. Calculate the total salary.

## 🎯 Functions

33. Create `def` functions to generalize the logic from steps 11–15 and 26–32.
34. Call the function from step 11 using both positional and keyword arguments.
35. Write a calculator function that takes three parameters (`int`, `int`, `str`) to perform add/sub/mul/div. Default the 3rd argument to `"add"`.
36. Modify the calculator to return a tuple of all operations `(add, sub, mul, div)` when the 3rd argument is `"all"`.
37. Write a function that accepts a string like `"inceptez technologies"` and returns:

* Capitalized
* Uppercase
* Length
* Word count
* Ends with “s” (True/False)
* Replace ‘e’ with ‘a’

38. Create a `promo` function with three parameters: `amount`, `offer_percent`, and `offer_cap_limit`. Apply the discount logic and return the final amount.

* a. Call with all parameters
* b. Call using default parameter
* c. Call using arbitrary arguments (`*args`)
* d. Call using keyword arguments (`**kwargs`)

39. Create a higher-order function `promo(amount, offer_percent, offer_cap_limit, lam)` where `lam` is a lambda function performing the discount.
40. Recreate the function from step 38 entirely as a lambda expression.

---

## 🎯 Exception Handling

41. Apply exception handling to the calculator (step 35):

    * If either of the first two arguments are non-integer, raise an exception and re-call the function after converting them to integers.
42. In the `promo` function (step 38), raise an exception if the second argument (`offer_percent`) is negative.

---

## 🎯 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

43. Create a package named `inceptez.usecases`.
44. Inside the package, create a module called `oops`.
45. Create two classes: `Mask` and `Endecode`.
46. In the `Mask` class, define a variable `addhash = 100` and a method `hashMask(str)` that returns the hash of `str + addhash`.
47. In the `Endecode` class, define `prefixstr = "aix"` and a method `revEncode(str)` that returns `prefixstr + reverse(str)`.
48. Create another module in the same package that instantiates objects `objmask` and `objendecode` for the respective classes.
49. Create a list `["arun", "ram kumar", "yoga murthy"]`, and use `map()` to apply `hashMask()` to all elements and print the results.
50. Apply `revEncode()` on the same list using `map()` and print the encoded values.
51. Add a method `revDecode()` inside the `Endecode` class to decode the values encoded in step 50.
